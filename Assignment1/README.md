# Assignment 1
## Assignment Description
Write a program to divide two n-digit signed integers (where n ranges from 1 to 1000). Prepare a set of slides with the following information:

 

Slide 1: Pseudocode for your program

 

Slide 2: Performance of your program on 1000 random inputs of size n = 4

Slide 3: Performance of your program on 1000 random inputs of size n = 8

Slide 4: Performance of your program on 1000 random inputs of size n = 16

Slide 5: Performance of your program on 1000 random inputs of size n = 32

Slide 5: Performance of your program on 1000 random inputs of size n = 64

Slide 6: Performance of your program on 1000 random inputs of size n = 128

Slide 7: Performance of your program on 1000 random inputs of size n = 256

Slide 8: Performance of your program on 1000 random inputs of size n = 512

 

Slide 9: Plot the average performance on inputs of various sizes and conjecture a time/space complexity for your implementation.

Slide 10: Analyze the pseudocode in Slide 1 and discover the time/space complexity of your program.

Slide 11: A link to your program on Github or elsewhere. There is no need to identify yourself in the program or on Github.

Submit the slides on Webcourses.
